# LLM-Book-Recommender

## Description

This project provides a **book recommendation system** using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **emotional tone analysis**, and a **Gradio dashboard** for interactive user experience. The system uses a dataset of 7,000 books from Kaggle to provide book recommendations based on user preferences, emotional tone, and genre.

### Dataset Used:
- **[7K Books with Metadata Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dylanjcastillo/7k-books-with-metadata)**
  - This dataset contains metadata for 7,000 books, including titles, authors, genres, descriptions, and more.

## Features

- **Text Data Cleaning:**  
  - Code for cleaning the text data is available in the notebook `data-exploration.ipynb`.
  
- **Semantic (Vector) Search:**  
  - Built a vector search system and a vector database, allowing users to find similar books based on a natural language query.  
  - Code in the notebook `vector-search.ipynb`.
  
- **Text Classification:**  
  - Applied **zero-shot classification** using LLMs to classify books into categories like "fiction" or "non-fiction".  
  - Code in the notebook `text-classification.ipynb`.

- **Sentiment Analysis & Emotional Tone Extraction:**  
  - Used LLMs to analyze the sentiment and emotional tone of book descriptions (e.g., suspenseful, joyful, sad).  
  - Code in the notebook `sentiment-analysis.ipynb`.

- **Gradio Web Application:**  
  - Created a user-friendly web app using Gradio where users can input book descriptions and get recommendations based on their emotional tone and category preferences.  
  - Code in `gradio-dashboard.py`.
